## Search Engine
This is a Python-based text search engine that uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and cosine similarity to find the most relevant documents in a corpus. The project processes text files, builds a TF-IDF index, and allows users to perform keyword-based searches interactively.

# Feature
- Batch Document Processing: Automatically reads and processes all text files in a specified folder.
- TF-IDF Indexing: Converts documents into a vectorized form for efficient similarity computation.
- Cosine Similarity Matching: Ranks documents based on relevance to user queries.
- Interactive Query Interface: Allows users to input search queries and view results in real-time.

# Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
Required Python libraries:
  - nltk
  - scikit-learn
